#PermCheck
##Task Description
<pre>
A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.
A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.
For example, array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2
is a permutation, but array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
is not a permutation.
The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.
Write a function:
int solution(vector<int> &A);
that, given a zero-indexed array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.
For example, given array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2
the function should return 1.
Given array A such that:
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
the function should return 0.
Assume that:
N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
Complexity:
expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
Elements of input arrays can be modified.

##Solution

<pre>
// you can also use includes, for example:
// #include <algorithm>
int solution(vector<int> &A) {
    // write your code in C++98
    int N = A.size();
    if(N == 0) return 0;
    for(int i=0; i<A.size(); i++){
        if (A[i] > N) return 0;
        while(A[i]!=i+1 && A[i]-1 != i && A[A[i]-1]<=N && A[i]!= A[A[i]-1]){
            swap(A[i], A[A[i]-1]);
        }
        if (A[i] != i+1) return 0;
    }
    return 1;
}
